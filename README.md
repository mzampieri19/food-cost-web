### Food Cost Calculator

### Work in Progress

- This app was designed to help the menager at the restaurant I used to work at, it makes calculating the food cost for particular dishes easier. The app contains the following features. 

1. Add Ingredients: add ingredient details, such as name, amount, unit and cost to create a running list of ingredients that can be used to create dishes.
   
2. Add Dishes: create dishes from the list of ingredients, choose how much of each ingredient goes in each dish and the app will calculate how much is spent on each ingredient with the given proportions, app will also calculate the total cost to make the dish and profit made.  

3. List: list all ingredients and dishes showing all the details, can also select to view a picture and short description

4. Edit: ability to edit all ingredients and dishes, an edit to an ingredient will change any dish that contains that ingredient

5. Delete: delete any ingredient or dish or delete all at once. 

6. Persistance: items are kept once the app reloads or shuts down.
